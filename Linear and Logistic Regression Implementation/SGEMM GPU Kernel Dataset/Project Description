In this project, the objectives were to implement a gradient descent algorithm with batch update without using linear or logistic regression model and the goal is to predict the GPU run time. This report details the various experiments conducted using the dataset to understand the effect of tuning hyperparameters of the gradient descent algorithm. Also, the effect of the use of various independent variables/ features in prediction is evaluated and the best model was selected through experimentation.
